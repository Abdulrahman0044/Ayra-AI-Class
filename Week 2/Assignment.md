### Assignment
#### Task1: Create a Simple Age Verification System
Write a Python script that takes an age as 34 and returns a message indicating whether the person is a minor, an adult, or a senior citizen.

#### Instructions:

Use if, elif, and else statements to check the age and print:
"You are a minor." if the age is less than 18.
"You are an adult." if the age is between 18 and 64 (inclusive).
"You are a senior citizen." if the age is 65 or older.

Hint:
You will use comparison operators (<, <=, >=) to determine which message to print based on the user's age.

#### Task2: Multiplication Table
Create a Python script that prints all even numbers from 1 to 100, each on a new line.

#### Instructions:

Use a for loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to 100.
Print each number on a new line.
